# NACHA Utility

## Background

Working in banking, merchant processing, and the payments industry for several years ranging from a PM to other business-related roles, I’ve frequently encountered hurdles on the business operations side related to processing ACH files, specifically the lack of a user-friendly, readable format. Recognizing this gap, I initially developed an Excel-based solution capable of parsing ACH files to insert appropriate headers for each record and field. This manual tool proved invaluable over the years, playing a key role in enhancing both business and technical processes, and resolving critical and time-sensitive operational issues. However, given my high value principles of efficiency and scalability, and recognizing that the Excel solution required minimal manual setup effort, I challenged myself to find a more streamlined solution, which led to this project.

## Project Overview:

Motivated by the challenges faced on the business operations side and my personal interest in learning software development, I embarked on creating an alternative solution: a NACHA parsing utility. This utility is designed to automate the conversion of NACHA formatted files into both JSON and CSV formats. The CSV file is intended to provide a more accessible and readable format for business operations teams, while the JSON format caters to the more tech-savvy individuals and downstream applications. The utility currently supports several Standard Entry Class Codes, including WEB, TEL, PPD, CCD, and COR, with plans to support other SEC codes including IAT in future releases.

## Why This Project Matters:

This tool was born out of a genuine need to bridge the gap between technical file formats and operational usability. It’s designed for those in the payments industry who, like myself, have faced tangible frustrations working with ACH files without a practical tool on the business side. By automating what was once a manual process, this utility aims to reduce operational overhead, increase accuracy, and ultimately support better financial management practices.
